PTDeploy Incomplete Modules
-------------------------------------

/opt/ptdeploy/ptdeploy/src/Bootstrap.php
line 8
// @todo document this feature that allows a user to provide a json envoronment variable of parameters

/opt/ptdeploy/ptdeploy/src/Core/Base/Controller/Base.php
// @todo child controllers should specify this
This is a massive method that specifies what to do as default actions .
The method is too big, and this should nt be specified in core. This should be specified in the XXXRequired of
an application, so, we copy this into PTConfigureRequired, PTDeployRequired, PTTestRequired etc
line 114 // @todo we should be able to specify an alias as well as a module
In an autopilot file we call modules by their exact name. since we have aliases we should be able to use them
The below line needs to find whatever logic get alias from modulename and use that instead of module = currentKey
So, it should look like:
module = getModuleNameFromAliasIfNeeded($currentKey);


/opt/ptdeploy/ptdeploy/src/Core/Base/Info/Base.php
line 16 // @todo some app settings class should contain this instead, so an individual pyramid app can specify those
this should nt be specified in core. This should be specified in the XXXRequired of
an application, so, we copy this into PTConfigureRequired, PTDeployRequired, PTTestRequired etc

ModelGroups should be more modular.

Dapperfy must use templateing like clefoy does

remove references to $this->baseTempDir

Github SSH prompt on first Connect!!
write a flag file to ignore on first connection... or it'll hang waiting

Concepts
--------
database should use templating for config
git and svn should have web server reset functions removed
